#managing
i manage mine with [gnu stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a free, portable, lightweight symlink farm manager. this allows me to keep a versioned directory of all my config files that are virtually linked into place via a single command. this makes sharing these files among many users (root) and computers super simple. and does not clutter your home directory with version control files.

#installing
stow is available for all linux and most other unix like distributions via your package manager.

- `sudo pacman -S stow`
- `sudo apt-get install stow`
- `brew install stow`

or clone it [from source](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=stow) and [build it](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/stow.git/tree/INSTALL) yourself.

#how it works
by default the stow command will create symlinks for files in the parent directory of where you execute the command. so my dotfiles setup assumes this repo is located in the root of your home directory `~/dotfiles`. and all stow commands should be executed in that directory. otherwise you'll need to use the `-d` flag with the repo directory location.

to install most of my configs you execute the stow command with the folder name as the only argument. 

to install my **herbstluft** theme _greybeard_ use the command:

`stow herbstluftwm`

this will symlink files to `~/.config/herbstluftwm` and various other places.

but you can override the default behavior and symlink files to another location with the `-t` (target) argument flag. 

to install the **ryu-login** you need to execute the command:

`stow -t / ryu-login` 

this will symlink the file to `/etc/issue`.

**note:** stow can only create a symlink if a config file does not already exist. if a default file was created upon program installation you must delete it first before you can install a new one with stow. this does not apply to directories, only files.

#tl;dr
navigate to your home directory

`cd ~`

clone the repo:

`git clone http://git.xero.nu/dotfiles.git`

enter the dotfiles directory

`cd dotfiles`

install the zsh settings

`stow zsh`

install zsh settings for the root user

`sudo stow zsh -t /root`

install awesomewm theme

`stow awesome`

uninstall awesome theme

`stow -D awesome`

install herbstluftwm

`stow herbstluftwm`

etc, etc, etc...
